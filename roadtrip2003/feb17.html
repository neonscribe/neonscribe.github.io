At the end of every winter, like clockwork, my grandparents would pack
the
car, shake the New York snow off their coats and head south to Florida.
This
was back in the day of shuffleboard courts, orange groves and--poor
Nana--unforgiving cotton swimsuits with pinching metal zippers.
Explorers of
distant lands, they said Florida was a different animal than Cape Cod,
where
my family spent a couple of weeks every summer. The beaches were
longer, the
water warmer and the shellfish sweeter. They had spoken so often of the
Sunshine State's soft, white sand that nothing could have made us
happier
than the spring they returned with sacks of the stuff in their trunk,
shoveled into neatly tied cotton sacks. My grandfather ceremoniously
unleashed the bounty, pouring it into our sandbox. As promised, it was
silken, cool and white. The stuff we'd previously shoveled through our
Sandy
Andy was a closer cousin to kitty litter than to this stuff.<br>
<br>
Crossing the border, part of me still expected some glimpse of the
Florida of
the '50s. There were a few, but not many. I was excited to spot an
orange
grove, but it was the only one I saw there. There were a few quaint, if
practical, touches, like the device at the rest stop that automatically
shot
water at your windshield to hose off the tacky coating of smushed bugs.
Each
squirt felt like a little howdy:&nbsp; "Welcome to Jeb country."
"Welcome to
the land of stolen elections." "Welcome to the swamp."<br>
<br>
It turned out we were visiting Florida at the same time as our pals
Rick and
Sue Ayre and their kids. We'd had plans to stop in to see Rick's
parents, and
his sister and her family, but luck would have it that we were there
just at
the right time for full-metal Ayeration. Martha, Andy and their kids
live in
Gulf Stream, right next to Palm Beach, where we holed up. It had been
so long
since we'd seen any Ayres that there was a ton of catching up to do.
Rick's
mom, Helen, who has been battling more than her share of health
problems,
looked very well and was lively company. Russ is as healthy and
energetic as
ever and continues in his reign as benevolent king grandpa. Martha has
turned
into a serious runner and though she always looked amazing now she now
looks
even more so. Andy was charming, even after long days doctoring, and
was kind
enough to geek out with me over our many architectural drawings. And
Remy and
Cosmo were patient as Rufus scurried around their house, stealing their
toys.
As truly great hosts do, Martha and Andy offered us the things we
missed most
on the road: wonderful home-cooked meal and use of their washing
machine.
(Hotels charge so much for laundry that you might as well throw out
your
dirty socks and underwear and buy new.) We left their house feeling
very well
cared for, indeed.<br>
<br>
Rick and Sue were staying at the Ritz down the road, as we were. Their
kids
were at Martha's, doing the cousin thing. And so, we had the luxury of
some
late-night chats in the hotel's lounge. Both of them looked wonderful
and
seemed great and are much wrapped up in a business Rick is working on.
It had
been so long since we'd seen each other that it felt like we were
communicating in headlines: Russell is getting married. Kate graduated.
Colin
has a bad ankle sprain...The stories filled in and the balance resumed.
It
felt perfectly normal to be sitting in a fancy hotel so far from home,
fleshing out our continuing stories with broad brush strokes. Over the
next
couple of days, as they always are, they were completely generous in
sharing
their family with us, making us feel one of their bubbling brood. <br>
<br>
But it would be an incomplete story if I failed to report on the hotel.<br>
<br>
Obviously, we stay in lots and lots of hotels. I adore a good hotel.
Fresh,
fluffy towels! Fresh, fluffy robes! No question--I'm a huge fan of
seamless
service. Good hotels charge lots of money on the promise of delivering
exactly that. So, when things go wrong, it really, really pisses me
off. As I
type those words, I'm recoiling at my own privileged, cranky
babyheadedness.
Bad service is a long way from being truly horrible thing, like, oh,
say,
subverting the democratic process or cancer or genocide. But right now,
selfishly, our tiny road trip reality is defined in good part by life
in
hotels. And so...<br>
<br>
We got to the Palm Beach Ritz around 8 p.m. We checked into our room,
having
driven a long day and feeling way too tired to explore the nearby town.
We
got Rufus settled in and headed for the hotel's restaurant. It was full
up,
indoors and out. We asked the hostess how long a wait it would be for a
table. <br>
"About twenty minutes," she replied, and suggested we get a drink at
the bar
while we waited. <br>
<br>
No problem. We settled in with a couple a margaritas, the rumbling road
slipping away with each sip. At about half an hour another hostess came
over
to us as we sat at the bar.<br>
<br>
"Have you been helped?" she asked.<br>
<br>
"Well, yes," we said, and then thought twice about the question. "I
mean, we
asked for a table about a half an hour ago."<br>
<br>
"Oh!" she said, sounding genuinely put out. "I don't have any <span
 style="font-style: italic;">tables.</span> You'll have to wait."<br>
<br>
She bustled off in a huff.<br>
<br>
Puzzling. She came up to us. Had she approached simply to taunt us
about our
tableless status? <br>
<br>
We switched to sipping fizzy water, as we hadn't managed lunch that day
and
one drink was getting us hammered. At 45 minutes we asked hostess
number one
if a table was in the offing any time soon. She said she'd look into
that. At
50 minutes, hostess number one offered us a table inside. Though we'd
requested an outdoor table, we leapt at it. Then, hostess number two
walked
us to a table outside, apologizing all the while that it was all they
had.
<br>
<br>
Clearly, they were trying to keep us of balance.<br>
<br>
Our waiter took our order and offered more drinks. What with food on
the
horizon, perhaps another would go down nicely. The second round of
margaritas
appeared promptly, though it was the last thing that did. We were
falsely
encouraged that food would soon arrive when a server brought knives to
the
table. They ridiculously large, like something from the evidence table
at the
O.J. Simpson trial. And they were a sham--it would be eons before we'd
need
them.<br>
<br>
Half an hour later our glasses were empty and we were so hungry we were
ready
to start asking folks at nearby tables for a bite or two. We questioned
the
hotel's wisdom in arming us.<br>
<br>
I caught the waiter's eye and he came by the table.<br>
<br>
"Would you have a bread basket?" I asked. "We've been here quite a
while and
we're really hungry."<br>
<br>
"Oh, the bread looked a little stale, so I decided not to serve it," he
replied and then scurried away.<br>
<br>
Moments later, the table next to ours was magically delivered manna
from
heaven in the form of a bread basket. We watched as they sampled.
Perhaps
they had a more careless waiter, one less concerned about quality. But
no. No
teeth broke on its stale contents. In fact, no one looked even a bit
unhappy
about what they were eating. More time passed. I was ready to eat my
hand.
Once again, I caught our waiter's eye. He came back. <br>
<br>
"It seems that they've found some bread worthy of serving in the
kitchen," I
said, pointing to the next table.<br>
<br>
He noted the lucky diners at the next table, buttering rolls. <br>
<br>
"I'll look into that," he said, inspiring little confidence as he once
again
disappeared.<br>
<br>
Maybe 10 more minutes passed. A waiter we hadn't yet met delivered a
plate of
napkin-wrapped bread to our table. <br>
Seconds later, our original waiter appeared and examined it. <br>
<br>
"Oh," he said. "He brought you...<span style="font-style: italic;">different</span>
bread." Once again, he turned on
his heel and vanished.<br>
<br>
Different bread? <br>
<br>
Moments later, actual food arrived. We had now been in the restaurant
for two
hours and--miracle of miracles--food was about to reach our lips. The
dinner
was fine. Serviceable, if unmemorable. Just as we finished, the evening
picked up considerably: Rick and Sue appeared, as if on cue, from the
gardens
below the balcony where we were sitting.<br>
<br>
Later on, happily Ayreated and returning to our room, we considered the
next
day's needs. We both require coffee immediately upon waking. To insure
that,
we thought we'd go ahead and use that little hang tag they leave in on
your
bed at night--the one for ordering the next day's breakfast to be
delivered
at a particular time. No such luck. Our room had no such tag. We had
seen
them hanging on other doors, so we knew they existed. And we considered
calling to the front desk to get someone to bring one around, but we
were
sleepy. In an act of stupidity, we took our chances.<br>
<br>
The following morning, relying on the bright, bright sun to give us our
initial jumpstarting jolt, we took Rufus for a romp by the ocean. He
was
joyous--zipping along the breaking surf like a puppy. We didn't notice
the
"no dogs" sign until we were exiting the beach. Though it did explain
the
dour looks we got from a number of beach walkers. Undaunted, we
strolled
across the street with the panting Rufus in search of a coffee joint
with a
few outdoor tables and a bowl of water for fur boy. We did find such a
place--a little mom and pop shop that had apparently had an unexpected
morning rush: every table was filled with dirty dishes and no one was
making
a move to clear them. Still, they were nice enough. They brought water
for Ru
and coffee and scrambled eggs for us. The water glasses were
thoughtfully
marked with the fuschia lipstick favored by those who sipped from them
before
us, a fact I unfortunately discovered after draining half the glass.<br>
<br>
Ick.<br>
<br>
At a nearby table, a large 70-something fellow with a heavy NY accent
bellowed into his cell phone, "I'm in <span style="font-style: italic;">FLOR</span>IDA.
It's 70 degrees! It's
Bee-you-tee-ful!" It was a cell phone conversation we would hear
repeated
numerous times during our stay in the sunshine state, each made by
different
callers in different places, but all with pretty much the same accent.<br>
<br>
Our second day at The Ritz, still menu hang-tagless, we decided to try
calling room service for breakfast. At least they were honest: it would
take
at least an hour for coffee to reach us, they apologized. Hoping to get
on
with the day a little sooner than that, we foolishly decided to try the
hotel's restaurant again. As we walked up to the restaurant we saw the
hallway was choked with people waiting to be seated. There was the
young
hostess from our first night there. The poor thing was looking just
miserable.<br>
<br>
"How long for a table?" I asked.<br>
<br>
"About 20 minutes," she muttered, unable to make eye contact while
lying.
Then she added, almost whispering "maybe longer."<br>
<br>
Another hostess--an uber hostess--appeared and started bossing the poor
junior hostess around. As she did, I glanced down and counted 14 names
ahead
of ours on her list. Unless they seated someone every minute, this
wasn't
going to be a 20 minute wait. I stopped counting just in time to hear
uber
hostess tell her,<br>
<br>
"If this party or this party asks for a table, seat them before anyone
else."<br>
<br>
She said this is clear earshot of at least 6 couples standing nearby.
Amazed,
and pondering the potential diners' possible mob connections, I was
interrupted by the junior hostess.<br>
<br>
"Do you want the buffet or do you want to order off the menu?" she
asked.<br>
<br>
"I don't know," I said. "We haven't eaten here before."<br>
<br>
She handed us menus, which we were considering when Uber approached us.<br>
<br>
It's important to note that this day--though clear--was very windy. No
one
was sitting out on the restaurant's balcony. <br>
<br>
"We'd sit outside if you'll serve out there," I offered. <br>
<br>
"OK," <br>
<br>
</span></font><font size="+1"><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">"So,
which will it be? Buffet or from the menu," uber asked, taking the
menus away
from us. Mere diners can't be trusted with such powerful items.<br>
<br>
"Um, we hadn't quite decided," I said. <br>
<br>
"You'll sit outside, then," she said pointing us toward the doors.<br>
<br>
"Could we have the menus back?" I asked. <br>
<br>
Looking annoyed, she acquiesced.<br>
<br>
It wasn't nearly as windy out on the balcony as expected. We found a
protected corner and felt smug that we'd outwitted another horrific
wait. It
was lucky we decided on the buffet because nothing resembling service
was
coming our way. We got up and helped ourselves to food. One cup of
coffee was
poured by a waiter who disappeared, never to be seen again. I took to
walking
over to the balcony's coffee station--the one set up for the serving
staff--to refill my cup. If anyone noticed, they didn't try to stop me.
</span></font><font size="+1"><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">Just
as well. I know where they keep the big knives.<br>
<br>
Almost all we did that day was eat. Martha, Helen, Sue, Sarah and I had
a
fine ladies-who-lunch meal at <a href="http://www.sundyhouse.com/">The
Sundy
House</a>, sitting out in an extraordinary lush, green garden. If we
hadn't
all been married--or too young to consider such a thing--we would have
been
driven to propose to each other. Extraordinary setting, wonderful food,
great
company. And Sarah held her own very well as a verging-on-grown-up
member of
the party. If I were to visit this part of the world again, I'd
definitely
stay here. It's splendid--cool structures, bright Caribbean colors and
a
garden that sports a swimming pool you share with tropical fish. (And
yes--they take dogs.) <br>
<br>
Eric and I followed lunch with a driving tour of the fancy mansions out
in
Palm Beach. Well, more accurately, we toured the gigantic walls of the
fancy
mansions. You might occasionally get a glimpse of garden, but rarely
actual
house. And who knew our over-the-top Lexus was the Ford Taurus of this
part
of the world? Those with more than a couple of million to rub together
drive
Rolls or Bentleys or something else equally obscenely expensive. We
then
wedged in a little gym time and rested up so we'd be fresh for the
exceptional dinner Rick took us all out to at <a
 href="http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-1248681-cafe_l_europe_palm_beach-i">Cafe
L'Europe</a> in Palm Beach. We ordered well and plates circled the
table for
all to sample. My favorite was the quartet of soups I ordered, served
in tiny
tureens. I'm&nbsp; immediately convinced that tiny tureens are a
perfect
vessel. (And the soups were beet, curry, minted fresh pea and cucumber
dill--but saying that doesn't begin to do them justice.) <br>
<br>
There was a private party going on in the room next to ours. As it drew
to a
close, a parade of waiters dimmed the lights and carried glowing,
candlelit
items into the celebration--most intriguing. I asked our waiter what
they
were. "Ice swans," he smiled, saying he'd try to find one for us after
we'd
finished our dinners. We'd gone to dinner late and we closed the joint.
As
promised, after we finished, two candlelit swans were presented to us,
filled
with chocolate-dipped strawberries, tiny chocolates and cookies. Shiny <span
 style="font-style: italic;">and</span> happy!<br>
<br>
Driving out of Palm Beach the next day, we contemplated life in such a
place.
The beaches were spectacular. The tropical climate guarantees green and
lush.
Lovely homes--older ones, like Martha and Andy's--have a lot of soul.
But the
rush to McMansionize the place is disturbing. Still, it looks like a
good
life. Just don't stay at The Ritz.<br>
<br>
STATS<br>
<br>
Number of ice swans served to us: 2<br>
The hotel we'd never stay at again in Palm Beach: <a

Beach</a><br>
The hotel we'd choose instead: <a href="http://www.sundyhouse.com/">The
