the word "automobile" aloud. Listen carefully to those last two
syllables. Chop off the first two and you're left with the correct way
to
pronounce the name of Alabama's only port city. This lesson in southern
elocution was graciously given to us by Bill and Wendy X who are
hosting us at their home, the lovely <a
 href="http://www.bbonline.com/al/kateshepard/">Kate Shepard House</a>
located in--say it with
us--Mobile, Alabama.<br>
<br>
We chose this as a stop on our way to New Orleans. And we chose it in
an attempt to avoid the madness that is Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Far
be it from me to rain on anyone's parade, but Mardi Gras always looked
like exactly the kind of instiutionalized baccanal best avoided.
Travelling south at this time of year with plans to visit New Orleans,
meant figuring out where else to spend Fat Tuesday. A little research,
and
we found Mobile claimed to have been the birthplace of the celebration.
Good enough for us.<br>
<br>
We were lucky to find The Kate Shepard House. After too many nights in
fancy schmancy
hotels it was a relief to be in someone's home. And Bill and Wendy not
only allowed Rufus, they were excited to have him as a guest. </span></font><font

the proud owners of two year-old Koa, a sweet Chow who loves having
another dog in the house.</span></font><font size="+1"><span

I gave Ru the billing he deserves--as a good, well behaved pooch who
has manners that make him inn and hotel worthy. With rare exceptions,
Rufus is excited to be in the presence of other dogs. So it came of
something of a shock when we entered the inn, Koa and Rufus met, and
Rufus tuned into a growly, snappish pill. <br>
<br>
The innkeepers couldn't have been nicer about it, suggesting Ru was
tired from his travels and would feel more hospitibily inclined toward
Koa the next day. I
wondered if he was worried about being pounced on by a pup, due to his
recent shoulder injury. But whatever it was, it was behavior we hadn't
previously seen and we were mortified. Here were these nice, nice folks
offering up their nice, nice dog as a playmate. They had every right to
think we were a delusional people who thought their nasty little dog
was well trained. <br>
<br>
After a good night's sleep, we were all in better stead to meet up
again. Rufus, Koa, Bill and Eric went for a stroll around the
neighborhood, and Rufus came to accept that Koa might be OK company
after all. At breakfast (eggs and garlic grits--yummy!) we spent time
chatting
with the inn's only other guest: Lowell, an older gentleman farmer from
Ohio who loved the blues and had been going to Mardi Gras celebrations
in New Orleans for decades. Last year, he found the grand mal
celebration lacking and decided to come to Mobile in search of missing
merriment. According to Lowell, who was dripping in easily 10 pounds
worth of plastic bling thrown from parade floats, Mobile's celebration
was smaller, but more managable. <br>
<br>
With Ru and Koa now friends, and Bill and Wendy generously offering to
watch him, we set of for a day of prowling the city and experiencing
Fat Tuesday, Mobile-style. The weather was Seattlesque: a misty rain
followed us throughout the day. We gambolled from neighborhood to
neighborhood, ogling the lovely old homes and cozying up to barricades
when we'd run into a parade, which was frequently. In fact, the parades
are constant. And, just like pictures or film you might have seen,
they're filled with themed floats, Mardi Gras Kings and Queens and
their courts flinging plastic beads, candy, Moon Pies, stuffed animals
and all manner of loot out into the crowds. We'd read in the papers of
one float that was planning on throwing packages of Ramen--economical
and nutritious! Motorcycle cops sped by, beads swinging from their
bikes making sure all appropriate body parts were covered. (The only
bare breasts we saw were replicas on a string of Mardi Gras beads.) <br>
<br>
We'd been warned by our hosts that some folks too this thing much to
seriously and would just about grab stuff out of your hands as you
caught it, but this wasn't our experience. When we got hungry or cold,
we'd peel off into a neighborhood, looking for coffee or grub. The air
was thick with smoke from countless barbecues; people were grilling up
and down neighborhood streets. The city was absolutely shut down,
except for bars and restaurants, where the party was in full swing.
Funky stands sold grilled homemade food and all manner of food on a
stick, the most popular being the time-tested corn dog and the nouvelle
interloper: the fried twinkie. (We passed on both, going for oyster po'
boys at a great old in a funky nabe.)<br>
