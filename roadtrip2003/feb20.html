Feb 20th-24th--Sarasota, FL<br>
<br>
</font></span></font><font size="+1"><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">Rolling
through Florida, we're disappointed that it's the most challenging of
all the
states we've visited for finding dog-friendly accommodations.
Generally, we tried to
balance advance research and reservations with some flex.
As it's prime-time for Florida tourism, we're bitten in the butt
by
this strategy. We'd hoped to get out to the Keys, but have little luck
in uncovering anywhere that isn't fully booked that will take Rufus. We
have a near miss with a lovely sounding little guest house that perches
on a quiet beach and loans kayaks. But it's not to be. Failing to turn
up anything more interesting, we're trapped in the velvet prison that
is The Ritz. And even then, only some Ritzes will take him. So, onward
and
westward. Next
stop--Sarasota.<br>
<br>
We tour quickly through South Beach, wowed by the deco architecture and
marking it as a place worthy of visiting again. And then we cut across
the swamplands toward our next destination. If I were to return to
Florida, this is a place I'd *definitely* spend more time. Eric is

as we drive through the aptly named "Alligator Alley," heading for the
gulf-side of Florida. I see a flamingo, and </span></font><font
 size="+1"><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">unlike
those I've met previously, it can fly!<br>
<br>
We'd been looking forward to stopping for a few days, to walking some
beaches and curling up with books and newspapers. This was the part of
the trip where we planned on recharging--no visiting, no schedules. But
as with so many things in life, what's going to happen isn't
neccesarily
what you've planned.<br>
<br>
We check into the Sarasota Ritz and it's instantly winning points for
running well. It's a big, new shiny hotel with too much marble and
too many chandeliers. But the staff get the service thing
and do it well, giving Rufus a warm welcome, so that's a happy thing.
The king has had supper and has developed the rituals of an old man
dog.
After he eats dinner he wants to go to bed. And that
means getting lifted up onto the bed, which we obligingly do when he
woofs at
it. An attentive maid noticed something missing from the bathroom when
she was turning down the room, and returns with it. When she knocks on
the door, Rufus feels obliged to bark, bounce, and warn us of a
potential intruder. She knocks, he instantly flings himself off the bed
and lands badly. In a split second we become people with a bud vase and
a
dog with an injured front leg. <br>
<br>
We feel around carefully on his shoulder, leg, and back and he doesn't
react with any obvious pain. We doubt there are any fractures. But he's
limping badly--it's probably a sprain. We decide to give it the night.
By morning, he's still a gimp boy. So, we find a dog-loving concierge
and make an appointment that afternoon at her veterinarian. Poor Ru.
Most dogs wind up injured in more heroic ways--chasing another
pooch, or simply running full-out. Our little guy has to suffer the
indignity of an injury received in the line of duty, living a life of
too much privilege, jumping off a bed at the Ritz.<br>
<br>
We pull up to the vet's, somewhere in strip mall land in Sarasota. The
technician working the front desk makes heavy weather of the fact that
even though Ru's rabies vaccine is current in 49 of the 50 United
States, in Florida, he's due for one. He needs records of the almost
two year-old vaccine
faxed from our Seattle vet, which we arrange for on our cell. And then
he drops the whole thing as an issue. Whatever. Oprah is blaring from a
TV set in the corner. No one is watching and Ru is flinching at the
yelps coming from the back of the hospital, tugging at his leash to go
out the door, knowing that's the way to GET OUT OF HERE.&nbsp; Even
though we have an appointment, we wait more than an hour for Ru to see
the doc, who is a very young and very kind Doogie Houser sort of vet.
While we wait, an elderly woman with a raven-black architectural
beehive of a 'do chats me up. She loved her dog so, but he died,
she says. Just like her two husbands. So she doesn't want another--of
either. Breaks your heart. She's just there with her friend who brought
a cat in to be
treated. <br>
<br>
"How long have you lived in Florida?" I ask. <br>
<br>
"Moved here in the 60's," she said. "Left my job and apartment in
Manhattan and just went." When she smiles, you can see that as a young
woman she was a stunner. <br>
<br>
"Didn't have a job so I slept in the park," she continued,
matter-of-factly. <br>
<br>
Clearly, this is just the headlines.<br>
<br>
"I went on lots of interviews, but nothing. Then, one day I see a job
in the paper that pays $5 an hour. Who do you have to kill to get that
one, I wondered?" she continued.<br>
<br>
Turns out, the gig was developing leads for cemetery plot salesmen.
She'd go door-to-door, looking for prospects. <br>
<br>
"I'm really a shy person," she explained, "So I could only do it a
couple of hours a day."<br>
<br>
There wasn't a lot about her that communicated shyness, but two hours
daily sounded like a fair limit for ringing
doorbells to ask people if they'd thought about investing in a very,
very small plot of real estate.<br>
<br>
"At one house, I found a young guy. Handsome, too." she said. "So I
left him my phone number. I didn't think he wanted a plot but I hoped
he'd call." <br>
<br>
He did. Asked her to dinner, giving her the choice of his house, her
house, or a restaurant. She accepted, deciding she wanted to see if he
could cook. THEN she let him take her to a restaurant. Then they
married.<br>
<br>
"I like to say I rang his bell from the moment we met," she smiled. <br>
<br>
Ru is called into Doogie's inner sanctum. He's kind, gentle, Corgi mad
and deeply
apologetic for keeping us waiting for so long. After much careful
feeling and prodding, he's pretty sure nothing is broken. He notes
arthritis in Ru's legs and back and suggests a drug that will help
that, and also help him heal up from this injury, which he thinks is a
sprain. </span></font><font size="+1"><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">He
suggests a steroid shot. I'm not so sure about that.</span></font><font
 size="+1"><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">
And he suggests x-rays if we want to be sure nothing is broken. We say,
yes--go ahead and x-ray. And off Ru limps to the dreaded back of the
house. We wait quite a while and then Doogie comes out to ask if he can
sedate the dog. <br>
<br>
"Sedate like knock out or sedate like relax him a bit?" I asked.<br>
<br>
"Relax him a bit," he replied.<br>
<br>
"OK," we allowed and off Doogie goes. <br>
<br>
Feeling uneasy, I slip out to the parking lot to call my vet in
Seattle. She's great and drops everything to take my call. The Demax,
the stuff for the arthritis makes sense, she says. The steroid shot
doesn't--in fact, it would reduce the effectiveness of the Demax. <br>
<br>
I go back inside and Doogie returns. I don't want to say I've called my
vet in Seattle for a second opinion. So I say that I've had sports
injuries myself--true--and that my doc warned me against steroidal
shots for treatment--also true. It followed that I'd prefer he didn't
give the
dog the steroid shot.<br>
<br>
No problem, he said. The problem is, Ru is giving them such a time that
even mild sedation isn't going to do it for the x-ray. And he doesn't
want to knock him all the way out. As he's pretty sure there isn't a
break. Perhaps we'd want to skip the x-ray? <br>
<br>
Makes sense to us.<br>
<br>
Ru, who entered the back of the dog hospital limping like Grandpa McCoy
now walks out of the torture zone perfectly normally. Whatever
struggling he did with them back there has acted like some sort of
involuntary chiropractic session and he seems magically better. We slip
him Demax, just the same, and the limp only shows up again days later,
when he romps with excitement over a particularly loving welcome he's
given at hotel in Arizona. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. <br>
<br>
By now, plot woman and her cat-loving friend have departed. Oprah has
turned to local news. And Doogie doesn't want to charge us the full
rate as we've been there for three hours. We insist on paying the
entire balance. What a sweet man, but we want him to be able to afford
to continue practicing. <br>
<br>
Ru rests and continues to be well. The following day, we attempt beach
and manage a nice stroll, but sun turns to rain, driving us off. That
night, we explore Sarasota's downtown, finding a great, simple, funky
Cuban restaurant (El Habanero on Burns Court) and a gallery district
with a fine art house movie
theater. <br>
<br>
Stopping for couple of days has the contradictory effect of making us
want to move on. And so, we do. <br>
